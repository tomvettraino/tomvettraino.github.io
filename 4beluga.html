            <p>Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) are small, highly social whales known for their striking white color and friendly appearance. Often referred to as the "canaries of the sea" due to their diverse vocalizations, belugas are among the most charismatic and recognizable marine mammals.</p>
            <br> 
                <h4>Key Facts About Beluga Whales:</h4>
                <ul><br>
                    1. Physical Appearance:
                    <li>Color: Beluga whales are born gray or brown, but as they age, they gradually turn pure white, which helps them blend into the icy environments of the Arctic.</li>
                    <li>Size: Adult belugas typically grow to about 13-20 feet (4-6 meters) in length and weigh between 1,100 to 3,500 pounds (500-1,600 kg). Males tend to be larger than females.</li>
                    <li>Head: Belugas have a distinctive rounded forehead known as a melon, which is flexible and helps in echolocation.</li>
                    <li>Lack of Dorsal Fin: They do not have a dorsal fin, which helps them swim under ice and avoid heat loss in cold Arctic waters.</li>
                    <li>Neck: Unlike most whales, belugas have unfused cervical vertebrae, allowing them to move their heads up, down, and side to side, giving them a more expressive appearance.</li>
                    <br>
                    2. Habitat:
                    <li>Belugas primarily inhabit the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, where they can be found in coastal waters, estuaries, and even rivers. During the summer months, they often move into shallow bays and estuaries, while in winter, they stay in deeper waters.</li>
                    <li>Populations of beluga whales are found in areas such as Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia, and Norway.</li>
                    <br>
                    3. Diet:
                   <li>Belugas are opportunistic feeders, meaning they eat a wide variety of prey depending on what is available. Their diet includes fish, squid, shrimp, crabs, clams, and worms.</li>
                    <li>They use echolocation to find prey in murky or dark waters, emitting clicks and listening for the echoes to locate objects.</li>
                    <br>
                    4. Vocalizations:
                   <li>Beluga whales are known for their extensive range of sounds, including clicks, whistles, chirps, and bell-like tones. These vocalizations are used for communication within their social groups and for echolocation to navigate and hunt.</li>
                   <li>Because of their varied and melodious vocal abilities, belugas have earned the nickname "canaries of the sea."</li>
                   <li>Each beluga pod can have its own distinct set of sounds, helping them recognize each other in the wild.</li>
                    <br>
                     5. Social Behavior:
                    <li>Belugas are highly social animals that often travel in groups called pods, which can range from a few individuals to hundreds during migration.</li>
                    <li>Within these pods, belugas exhibit strong social bonds and are known to be very interactive, communicating constantly with vocalizations and body language.</li>
                    <li>They are also playful, sometimes seen chasing each other, interacting with objects like pieces of ice, or blowing bubbles.</li>
                    <br>
                    6. Reproduction:
                    <li>Female beluga whales give birth to a single calf every 3 years after a gestation period of about 14-15 months.</li>
                    <li>Calves are born in the warmer summer months in shallow waters and are typically about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long and weigh 175-200 pounds (80-90 kg) at birth.</li>
                    <li>Newborns are born with dark gray or brownish skin, which lightens as they age, eventually becoming white as adults.</li>
                    <br>
                    7. Echolocation:
                    <li>elugas are highly skilled in echolocation, using their melon (a fat-filled organ on their forehead) to focus and project sound. They produce a series of clicks that bounce off objects, helping them locate prey and navigate in dark or murky waters, especially under the ice.</li>
                    <br>
                    8. Adaptations to Cold:
                    <li>Beluga whales are well adapted to life in the Arctic. Their white coloration provides camouflage in icy waters.</li>
                    <li>They have a thick layer of blubber, which can be up to 5 inches (13 cm) thick, helping them stay warm in freezing waters.</li>
                    <li>The absence of a dorsal fin reduces heat loss and prevents injury from swimming under ice floes.</li><br>
                    9. Migration:
                    <li>Some beluga populations undertake seasonal migrations between feeding and breeding grounds. In summer, they are often found in shallow coastal waters or river estuaries, and in winter, they move to deeper waters under the sea ice.</li>
                    <li>Other beluga populations remain in the same general area throughout the year, depending on the availability of food and the extent of ice cover.</li><br>
                    10.Conservation Status:
                    <li>Beluga whales are currently classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, but some populations, such as the Cook Inlet beluga whales in Alaska, are considered endangered.</li>
                    <li>Major threats include climate change, which is rapidly altering their Arctic habitat, as well as pollution, ship traffic, oil and gas development, and commercial hunting in some areas.</li>
                    <li>Belugas are also vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and noise pollution, which can disrupt their communication and echolocation abilities.</li><br>
                    11. Human interaction:
                    <li>Belugas have a long history of interaction with humans, particularly with Indigenous peoples in the Arctic, who have traditionally hunted them for food, oil, and other resources. Today, Indigenous subsistence hunting continues in some areas under regulated management.</li>
                    <li>Belugas are a common attraction at aquariums and marine parks due to their friendly appearance and social behavior, although keeping them in captivity is controversial.</li><br>
                    12. Belugas in Rivers:
                    <li>Belugas are one of the few whale species that can survive in freshwater environments. They are often found in rivers during their summer migration, sometimes traveling hundreds of miles inland. This ability to move between salt and freshwater is an adaptation that allows them to access new feeding grounds.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Interesting Facts:</h4>
                    <li>Beluga whales can swim backward, a unique ability among whales, which helps them navigate in tight spaces under ice.</li>
                    <li>They have excellent vision both underwater and above water, and their hearing is finely tuned for detecting sounds in the water.</li>
                    <li>The belugaâ€™s melon can change shape, allowing the whale to focus sound in different directions.</li>
                    <li>Belugas are known for their curious and playful behavior toward humans, and they sometimes approach boats or play with objects in the water.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beluga whales are not just remarkable for their appearance, but also for their social intelligence, communication skills, and adaptability to life in the Arctic. Their playful nature and complex vocalizations make them one of the most fascinating marine mammals.</p>
