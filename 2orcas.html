            <p>Orcas, also known as killer whales (Orcinus orca), are one of the most powerful and recognizable marine mammals in the world. Despite their name, they are not whales but the largest members of the dolphin family (Delphinidae). These apex predators are highly intelligent, social, and are found in all of the world's oceans.</p>
            <br> 
                <h4>Key Facts About Orcas:</h4><br>
                <ul>
                    1. Physical Characteristics:
                    <li>Orcas are easily recognized by their black-and-white coloration. Their backs are black, while their undersides are white, with distinctive white patches above their eyes.</li>
                    <li>They have large dorsal fins, with males having fins up to 6 feet (2 meters) tall.</li>
                    <li>Males can grow up to 30 feet (9 meters) long and weigh up to 12,000 pounds (5,400 kg), while females are slightly smaller, reaching around 25 feet (7.5 meters) in length and weighing up to 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg).</li>
                    <br>
                    2. Diet:
                    <li>Orcas are apex predators, meaning they have no natural predators and sit at the top of the food chain.</li>                   
                    <li>They are carnivorous and have a diverse diet, which can include fish, seals, sea birds, squid, and even other marine mammals like whales. In fact, they have been observed hunting large whale species such as gray whales and minke whales.</li>
                    <li>Orcas often hunt in groups, using sophisticated cooperative hunting techniques, which is why they are sometimes referred to as the "wolves of the sea."</li>
                    <br>
                    3. Social Structure:
                    <li>Orcas live in matrilineal social groups called pods, which are led by an older, dominant female. These pods can consist of anywhere from a few individuals to more than 50 members.</li>
                    <li>These animals exhibit complex social behaviors and have strong bonds within their pods. They communicate through a series of clicks, whistles, and calls, and each pod has its own unique set of vocalizations, similar to dialects in human languages.</li>
                    <li>Orcas are known for their long lifespan. Females can live up to 90 years, while males tend to live around 50 to 60 years.</li>
                    <br>
                    4. Intelligence:
                    <li>Orcas are considered to be one of the most intelligent animals on Earth. Their problem-solving abilities, complex communication, and social structures are evidence of their high level of intelligence.</li>
                    <li>Some populations of orcas are known to use tools and hunt cooperatively, which demonstrates strategic thinking and learning behavior. For instance, orcas in Patagonia have been observed intentionally stranding themselves to catch seals on the beach, a learned behavior passed down through generations.</li>
                    <br>
                     5. Types of Orcas:
                    <li>There are several different ecotypes of orcas, each adapted to different habitats and diets. These include resident, transient, and offshore orcas, which have different prey preferences and social behaviors.</li>
                    <li>Resident orcas feed primarily on fish, especially salmon, and tend to live in the same area year-round.</li>
                    <li>Transient orcas, also known as Bigg's orcas, are more nomadic and prefer to hunt marine mammals like seals and sea lions.</li>
                    <li>Offshore orcas are less studied, but they are known to live further from shore and may feed on fish and sharks</li>
                    <br>
                    6. Habitat:
                    <li>Orcas are highly adaptable and can be found in all oceans, from the Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical waters. However, they tend to prefer coastal waters and areas with abundant prey.</li>
                    <li>Different populations of orcas are found around the world, with some groups staying in specific regions and others migrating across large distances.</li>
                    <br>
                    7. Conservation Status:
                    <li>While orcas are not considered endangered globally, some specific populations are at risk. For example, the Southern Resident orca population in the Pacific Northwest is critically endangered, largely due to a decline in salmon (their primary food source), pollution, and disturbances from boat traffic.</li>
                    <li>Orcas are also vulnerable to chemical pollution, overfishing, and the reduction of prey species, all of which can affect their health and reproductive success.</li>
                    <br>
                    8. Relationship with Humans:
                    <li>Historically, orcas have been feared by humans due to their name, "killer whales." However, there are no recorded incidents of wild orcas attacking humans.</li>
                    <li>In captivity, orcas have been popular attractions in marine parks, but this has sparked controversy due to concerns about their well-being. Orcas in the wild can travel hundreds of miles in a day, but in captivity, their movement is limited, which can lead to physical and psychological stress.</li>
                    <li>The 2013 documentary "Blackfish" brought significant attention to the ethical issues surrounding keeping orcas in captivity, leading to changes in public perception and calls for conservation efforts.</li>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Interesting Facts:</h4>
                   <li>Orcas have a varied communication system, with different vocalizations used for hunting, socializing, and navigating.</li>
                   <li>Female orcas go through menopause, a rare trait in the animal kingdom, allowing older females to focus on leading and caring for their pods.</li>
                   <li>Orcas have been observed teaching their young hunting techniques, showcasing their ability to pass knowledge through generations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Orcas are not only fascinating for their size and hunting abilities but also for their complex social structures and intelligence, making them one of the most intriguing marine species in the animal kingdom.</p>
