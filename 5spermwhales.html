            <p>Blue whales (*Balaenoptera musculus*) are the largest animals ever known to have existed, even larger than the biggest dinosaurs. These gentle giants are awe-inspiring due to their sheer size, unique behaviors, and essential role in marine ecosystems.
            <br> 
                Key Facts About Blue Whales:
                <ul>
                    1. Size and Weight:
                    <li>Blue whales can reach lengths of up tob100 feet (30 meters), which is about the length of two school buses.</li>
                    <li>They can weigh up to 200 tons (181 metric tonnes), with their tongues alone weighing as much as an elephant, and their hearts as much as a car.</li>
                    <br>
                    2. Appearance:
                    <li>Blue whales are a grayish-blue color, with lighter, mottled spots, but they can appear bright blue underwater.</li>
                    <li>They have a long, streamlined body with a small dorsal fin near the tail.</li>
                    <li>Their blowholes create a spout of water vapor that can shoot as high as 30 feet in the air.</li>
                    <br>
                    3. Diet:
                    <li>Despite their enormous size, blue whales feed almost exclusively on tiny krill (small shrimp-like animals).</li>
                    <li>During feeding season, a blue whale can consume up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tonnes) of krill per day.</li>
                    <li>They use a method called filter feeding, where they gulp large amounts of water and krill, then push the water out through their baleen plates, trapping the krill inside.</li>
                    <br>
                    4. Habitat:
                    <li>Blue whales are found in all major oceans except for the Arctic. They typically migrate between cold waters, where they feed, and warmer waters, where they breed.</li>
                    <li>They are found in the Southern Ocean, North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Indian Oceans.</li>
                    <br>
                     5. Communication:
                    <li>Blue whales are known for their deep, low-frequency vocalizations, which can be heard over hundreds of miles underwater. These sounds are some of the loudest produced by any animal.</li>
                    <li>Scientists believe these calls are used to communicate with other whales, navigate, and possibly even locate krill swarms.</li>
                    <br>
                    6. Reproduction and Lifespan:
                    <li>Blue whales typically give birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about 10 to 12 months.</li>
                    <li>A newborn blue whale is about 23 feet (7 meters) long and weighs around 3 tons.</li>
                    <li>Blue whales can live up to 80 to 90 years in the wild, although some have been recorded to live over 100 years.</li>
                    <br>
                    7. Conservation Status:
                    <li>Blue whales were heavily hunted during the 19th and early 20th centuries for their blubber, oil, and baleen. This led to a drastic decline in their population.</li>
                    <li>Today, blue whales are classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated global population of around 10,000 to 25,000 individuals.</li>
                    <li>Conservation efforts, including international whaling bans and protection laws, have helped blue whale populations slowly recover.</li>
                    <br>
                    8. Threats:
                    <li>Despite being protected from commercial whaling, blue whales face modern threats like ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and ocean noise pollution, which can interfere with their communication and navigation.</li>
                    <li>Climate change may also impact their food supply, as krill populations are dependent on cold water environments and sea ice.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Interesting Facts:
                    <li>The blue whale's heart is massive, weighing about 400 pounds (180 kilograms), and beats slowly, around 5-10 times per minute while diving.</li>
                    <li>The blue whaleâ€™s blow (the spout of water when they surface to breathe) is so powerful that it can be seen from miles away.</li>
                    <li>These whales can dive to depths of 500 meters (1,640 feet) and stay underwater for up to 30 minutes.</li>
                    <br>
                    Blue whales are not just majestic due to their size, but also because they represent one of the last remnants of Earth's once-vast marine megafauna, reminding us of the importance of protecting marine ecosystems.</p>
