            <p>Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are among the most well-known and loved species of whales, famous for their spectacular behaviors, such as breaching (leaping out of the water) and complex, melodious songs. They are baleen whales, which means they filter feed on tiny organisms using baleen plates instead of teeth.</p>
            <br> 
                <h4>Key Facts About Humpback Whales:</h4>
                <ul>
                    1. Physical Appearance:
                    <li>Humpback whales are large, reaching lengths of 40-50 feet (12-16 meters) and weighing around 25-30 tons. Females tend to be slightly larger than males.</li>
                    <li>Their bodies are dark grey or black, with distinctive white markings on their underbellies. These unique markings, along with the shape of their tail flukes, are used by scientists to identify individual whales.</li>
                    <li>They have long pectoral fins (up to one-third of their body length) with knobby edges, giving them their species name, Megaptera, which means "big wing."</li>
                    <li>Humpbacks also have a series of knobby protuberances called tubercles on their heads and jaws, each containing a hair, thought to help with sensory perception.</li>
                    <br>
                    2. Behaviors:
                    <li>Breaching: Humpback whales are known for their dramatic breaching behavior, where they leap out of the water and crash back down. This may be a form of communication, play, or to dislodge parasites.</li>
                    <li>Tail-slapping and flipper-slapping: These behaviors may also be used for communication or to herd prey.</li>
                    <li>Migration: Humpbacks undertake one of the longest migrations of any mammal, traveling thousands of miles between their feeding grounds in colder waters (like the North Atlantic or Southern Ocean) and their breeding grounds in warmer tropical waters (like the Caribbean, Hawaii, or off the coasts of Central and South America).</li>
                    <br>
                    3. Diet:
                    <li>Humpback whales are filter feeders, consuming krill, small fish, and plankton. They have baleen plates in their mouths, which they use to filter out food from the water.</li>
                    <li>One of their most famous feeding techniques is bubble-net feeding, a cooperative behavior where a group of humpbacks creates a circular "net" of bubbles to trap fish or krill. One or more whales blow bubbles beneath a school of prey, and then the group swims upward, mouths open, consuming the trapped food.</li>
                    <li>During feeding season, a humpback can eat up to 3,000 pounds (1,360 kg) of food per day.</li>
                    <br>
                    4. Whale Songs:
                    <li>Male humpback whales are known for their complex and long-lasting songs, which can last up to 30 minutes and be repeated for hours.</li>
                    <li>These songs are believed to play a role in mating, as only males sing, and their songs may serve to attract females or communicate with other males. Each population of humpbacks has its own distinct song, and the songs can evolve over time.</li>
                    <li>The songs can travel over long distances underwater and are one of the most studied and fascinating behaviors of these whales.</li>
                    <br>
                     5. Social Structure:
                    <li>Humpback whales are generally solitary, but they sometimes form small, temporary groups called pods, especially during feeding or migration. Unlike species like orcas, humpbacks don't have long-term social bonds outside of mother-calf relationships.</li>
                    <li>Mother-calf pairs are the most common and important social group in humpback societies. Calves stay with their mothers for about a year after birth.</li>
                    <br>
                    6. Reproduction and Lifespan:
                    <li>Humpbacks have a breeding season that occurs in warmer waters during the winter months. Females give birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about 11-12 months.</li>
                    <li>Newborn calves are about 10-15 feet (3-4.5 meters) long and weigh around 2,000 pounds (900 kg). They rely on their motherâ€™s rich milk for nourishment, growing rapidly in the first few months of life.</li>
                    <li>Humpbacks reach sexual maturity between 5-10 years of age, and they can live for 50-60 years, although some may live even longer.</li>
                    <br>
                    7. Migration:
                    <li>Humpback whales are famous for their long-distance migrations, which are among the longest of any mammal. They migrate annually between their feeding grounds in cold waters (like Alaska or Antarctica) and their breeding grounds in warmer, tropical waters (like Hawaii or the Caribbean).</li>
                    <li>Some humpbacks travel up to 16,000 miles (25,000 km) round trip during migration.</li>
                    <li>In the feeding grounds, they build up fat reserves (blubber) by gorging on krill and small fish, while in the breeding grounds, they generally fast and rely on their stored energy.</li>
                    <br>
                    8. Conservation Status:
                    <li>Humpback whales were heavily hunted during the 19th and early 20th centuries for their oil, meat, and baleen, leading to a dramatic decline in their population. By the mid-20th century, they were on the brink of extinction in many parts of the world.</li>
                    <li>Since the international ban on commercial whaling in 1986, humpback populations have made a significant recovery. Today, they are listed as "Least Concern" by the IUCN, though some populations remain endangered or vulnerable.</li>
                    <li>Major threats today include entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, noise pollution, and habitat degradation due to climate change.</li>
                    <br>
                    9. Humpbacks and Human Interaction:
                    <li>Humpback whales are often the stars of whale-watching tours due to their active surface behaviors, such as breaching, tail-slapping, and spy-hopping (where they poke their heads above the water to look around).</li>
                    <li>While generally not aggressive toward humans, humpbacks are large and powerful animals, and they must be treated with respect. Whale-watching guidelines exist in many areas to ensure safe and non-intrusive observation.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Interesting Facts:</h4>
                    <li>Humpback whales are named for the hump they create when they arch their backs to dive.</li>
                    <li>They are known to show altruistic behavior, as they have been observed protecting other species, like seals, from predators such as orcas.</li>
                    <li>Humpback whale populations are divided into different groups or stocks around the world, each with distinct migration routes and breeding grounds.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Humpback whales are not just incredible for their massive size, but also for their acrobatic displays, unique songs, and fascinating behaviors, making them one of the most admired and studied whale species on the planet.</p>
